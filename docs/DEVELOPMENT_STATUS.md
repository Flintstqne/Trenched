## 💡 PLANNED FEATURES

### Container Permission System

A team-based container permission system to prevent enemies from accessing friendly storage.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Team Chest Protection** | ✅ Complete | Enemies cannot open/break team chests in team-owned regions |
| **Protection Drops on Capture** | ✅ Complete | When region is captured, new owners can access all enemy containers |
| **Objective Bypass** | ✅ Complete | "Destroy Supply Cache" objective allows breaking enemy chests |
| **No Traditional Claims** | ✅ Complete | Protection tied to region ownership, not land claims |

#### Design Philosophy
- **Sector-Based Vulnerability**: Container protection is tied to who controls the region
- **Physical Access Points**: No invisible claim boundaries - if you can reach it, protection depends on region ownership
- **Effort-Based Access**: Enemies must work to access protected storage (capture region or complete objectives)
- **Capture = Full Access**: When a region is captured, ALL enemy containers in that region become accessible to the new owners

#### Container Types Affected
- Chests (single and double)
- Trapped Chests
- Barrels
- Shulker Boxes
- Hoppers, Droppers, Dispensers

> **Note:** Division Depots (planned) will NOT follow this behavior. When a region with enemy Division Depots is captured, the depots remain locked. Accessing a captured Division Depot opens YOUR OWN division's storage, not the enemy's. A special tool is required to raid enemy Division Depots and loot their contents.

### Division Depot System

A shared storage system for divisions, similar to Ender Chests but with physical vulnerability.

> **📄 Full Design Document:** [DIVISION_DEPOT_DESIGN.md](./DIVISION_DEPOT_DESIGN.md)

> **Key Difference from Regular Containers:** Division Depots do NOT follow normal capture rules. When a region is captured, regular containers become accessible, but Division Depots remain protected. Interacting with an enemy Division Depot opens YOUR division's storage, not theirs. A special raid tool is required to loot enemy depot contents.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Shared Division Storage** | ✅ Complete | Functions like Ender Chest - all division members access same inventory (54 slots) |
| **Physical Depot Block** | ✅ Complete | Configurable block material (default: CHEST) with custom NBT |
| **Depot Item Factory** | ✅ Complete | DepotItem.java - creates depot blocks and raid tools with NBT |
| **Depot Inventory Holder** | ✅ Complete | DepotInventoryHolder.java - custom holder for storage tracking |
| **Crafting Recipes** | ✅ Complete | DepotRecipes.java - registers shaped recipes for depot and raid tool |
| **Depot Database Layer** | ✅ Complete | SQLite tables for depot locations, storage, and raid history |
| **Depot Service Interface** | ✅ Complete | Full service API for depot operations (DepotService.java) |
| **Depot Service Implementation** | ✅ Complete | SqlDepotService with placement, storage, and raid logic |
| **Storage Persistence** | ✅ Complete | Item serialization/deserialization for database storage |
| **Sector Capture Vulnerability** | ✅ Complete | Depots become raidable when their sector is captured |
| **Division Raid Tool** | ✅ Complete | Special tool item with NBT tags (item factory method) |
| **Raid Channel Mechanic** | ✅ Complete | Raid start/complete/cancel with tracking maps |
| **Partial Loot Drop** | ✅ Complete | 30% of storage items drop on raid (configurable) |
| **Division Notifications** | ✅ Complete | Alerts when depot is raided |
| **Configuration Options** | ✅ Complete | Full config.yml section for depot settings |
| **Depot Listener** | ✅ Complete | DepotListener.java - block place/break/interact events |
| **Container Protection Integration** | ✅ Complete | ContainerProtectionListener excludes depot blocks |
| **Raid Channeling UI** | ✅ Complete | Title countdown during raid with movement check |
| **Main Plugin Integration** | ✅ Complete | DepotService, DepotRecipes, DepotListener wired in Trenched.java |
| **ConfigManager Integration** | ✅ Complete | All depot settings accessible via ConfigManager methods |
| **Particle Effects** | ✅ Complete | DepotParticleManager.java - ambient, vulnerable, placement, raid effects |
| **Ender Chest Behavior** | ✅ Complete | Any depot opens YOUR division storage, regardless of who placed it |
| **Admin Commands** | ✅ Complete | `/admin depot list/info/give/givetool/clear/remove` |
| **Officer/Commander Only** | ✅ Complete | Only officers and commanders can place depots |
| **Depot Limit Display** | ✅ Complete | Shows current/max depot count on placement |
| **Region Capture Alerts** | 📋 Planned | Notify division when their depots become vulnerable |

#### Depot Mechanics

1. **Placement**
   - Division members craft a Division Depot block (copper chest + custom NBT)
   - Place in any region to create access point to shared division storage
   - Multiple depots can exist - all access the same shared inventory

2. **Protection**
   - Depot is protected while region is owned/controlled by depot owner's team
   - Cannot be broken or accessed by enemies in friendly territory

3. **Vulnerability**
   - When region is captured by enemy team, all depots in that region become vulnerable
   - Enemies can use a special tool to "raid" the depot
   - Raiding drops a portion of stored items (configurable %)
   - Depot block is destroyed after raiding

4. **Strategic Considerations**
   - Depots are NOT 100% safe - encourages strategic placement
   - Place in well-defended regions, not frontline territories
   - Creates additional objectives for attackers (capture region → raid depots)
   - Division must choose between convenience (many access points) and security (fewer depots)

### Garrison Quick Travel System

A spawn-based travel system tied to the "Build Garrison Quarters" objective.

| Feature | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Spawn Map Item** | 📋 Planned | Players receive a map item when spawning in home region |
| **Region Grid GUI** | 📋 Planned | Map opens inventory grid showing current server state |
| **Garrison Teleport** | 📋 Planned | Can teleport to any garrison in friendly regions |
| **Distance Limit** | 📋 Planned | Map disappears after moving X blocks from spawn point |
| **One-Time Use** | 📋 Planned | Cannot use map again after it disappears |

#### Garrison Mechanics

1. **On Spawn (Home Region)**
   - Player receives a special map item in their inventory
   - Map item has custom NBT data tracking spawn location

2. **Map Usage**
   - Right-click map to open region grid GUI
   - GUI shows all 16 regions with current ownership status
   - Regions with friendly garrisons are highlighted/clickable
   - Click a garrison region to teleport there

3. **Map Expiration**
   - System tracks player's distance from spawn point
   - Once player moves X blocks away (configurable), map is removed
   - Prevents abuse of quick travel mid-game
   - Encourages immediate decision-making on spawn

4. **Strategic Implications**
   - Garrisons provide forward spawn options for team
   - "Build Garrison Quarters" objective now has major gameplay value
   - Teams can create spawn networks across the map
   - Losing a garrison region = losing a spawn point
